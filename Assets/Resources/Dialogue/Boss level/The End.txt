The battle is over, and to the victor goes the spoils.

Or, at least that would be the case, but It seems, in your anger, you accidentally destroyed the last engine parts with a stray

It looks like you won't be leaving this planet any time soon, but maybe that's for the better.
This way many other planets will be spared the carnage you displayed here.
